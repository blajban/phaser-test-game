* Abstract away phaser logic from particle system, make particle system more generic!
* Collisions for rotated rectangles??
* World vs scene? (render systems need the scene.. set the current scene as active in the world?)
* Scene handling, engine init etc
* Rendering order/layers in graphicsrenderer
* Layers/priority for systems
* Events, logging
